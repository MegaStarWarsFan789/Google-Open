# Google-Open
A little program I created with Python to open all of your favorite sites or searches, every time.
This is a program that will search in Google Chrome all your favorite searches, every time.
Here's how it works.
FIRST open GoogleOpen1.py. It will look like:
~~~
MAXIMUM SEARCHES OR URL'S: 10
Write '?' for help on first line
search or url:
Write "u" for url, "s" for search, or "e" to exit.
~~~
If you would like to use a URL, (Example, https://github.com/MegaStarWarsFan789) type "u" like this:
~~~
MAXIMUM SEARCHES OR URL'S: 10
Write '?' for help on first line
search or url:
Write "u" for url, "s" for search, or "e" to exit.u ( <==here )
~~~
Hit ENTER, then write your URL:
~~~
MAXIMUM SEARCHES OR URL'S: 10
Write '?' for help on first line
search or url:
Write "u" for url, "s" for search, or "e" to exit.u
https://github.com/MegaStarWarsFan789  ( <==here )
~~~
Hit ENTER.
If you want to search something (Example: what time is it in vatican city?) type "s" like this:
~~~
MAXIMUM SEARCHES OR URL'S: 10
Write '?' for help on first line
search or url:
Write "u" for url, "s" for search, or "e" to exit.s  ( <==here )
~~~
Hit ENTER.
Then, write your search:
~~~
MAXIMUM SEARCHES OR URL'S: 10
Write '?' for help on first line
search or url:
Write "u" for url, "s" for search, or "e" to exit.s
what time is it in vatican city  ( <==here )
~~~
ENTER. That's about it. Some IMPORTANT notes:
1: Please press "e" to exit, or your searches and URL's won't be written correctly.
2: Remember to use lowercase letters when you are writing "u", "s", or "e".
3: Every time you re-open GoogleOpen1.py, all changes will have been lost, so be careful if you want to add another link, to remember what it used to have so you can re- enter it.

Now, hit GoogleOpen2.py . This will open your searches.
